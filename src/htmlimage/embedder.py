    Converts a image in a series of HTML code that looks like an image
    but it's not.

    This is only a pastime and has no further utility other than understanding
    that this method renders an image that weights 1000 times more than the
    original image.

    Why did I do this?

    To test if gzip compression of this kind of "image" could come close to
    a JPG image (note: it doesn't). It also tests if could be an interesting way
    of showing embeded images in email clients like GMail that doesn't support
    data URIs (note: it isn't).

    See https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2013/02/embedded-images-in-html-email/
    for more information about image embedding in HTML emails with data URIs.
